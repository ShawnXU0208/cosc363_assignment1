openGL graphic development


• My program displays a simple space station erected on an planet.
In general, the space port is surrounded by wall, inside the wall, and outside the wall has not
been developed by aliens. So there is nothing outside.

• Inside the wall, the space port contains a header office building, which consists of a glass
building and a cyan ball on top of that. In addition, there is a radar on the top. On each side
of the header office building, there are 3 half sphere houses.

• There are 3 roads in my scene, the first one is straight, and pass through the opening of the
station. The other two are all round road.

• The spaceship is on a grey launch pad, and it is supported by three brace rods when landing.
Besides the space ship, there is a round pad, which is the place for passenger who is going to
board on spaceship.

• Sitting on the opposite of the spaceship is a windmill.

• The wall around the station is segmented by 12 towers, and two of the towers are connecting
together.

• On the straight road, there is a car travelling on it.

• There are 3 aliens able to be seen. One of them is waiting on the round pad besides the
spaceship, the other two are going on patrol.
